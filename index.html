              Naruto Uzumaki (うずまきナルト, Uzumaki Naruto) is a shinobi of Konohagakure. He became the jinchūriki
              of the Nine-Tails on the day of his birth — a fate that caused him to be ostracised by most of
              Konoha throughout his childhood. After joining Team Kakashi, Naruto worked hard to gain the village's
              acknowledgement all the while chasing his dream to become Hokage. In the following years, through
              many hardships and ordeals, he became a capable ninja regarded as a hero both by the villagers, and
              soon after, the rest of the world, becoming known as the Hero of the Hidden Leaf (木ノ葉隠れの英雄,
              Konohagakure no Eiyū, Literally meaning: Hero of the Hidden Tree Leaves). He soon proved to be one
              of the main factors in winning the Fourth Shinobi World War, leading him to achieve his dream and
              become the village's Seventh Hokage (七代目火影, Nanadaime Hokage, Literally meaning: Seventh Fire
              Shadow).

            Although starting off clumsy and untalented as the lowest graduate of his class in the Academy,
            Naruto persevered and improved rapidly as a late bloomer. He defeated strong shinobi such as
            Neji Hyūga and Gaara and became acknowledged by the Sannin for his potential in Part I. Under
            Jiraiya's tutelage for two-and-a-half years, Naruto grew strong enough to fight the members of
            Akatsuki; Konoha praised him as a hero of Hokage-material after he defeated Pain. During the
            Fourth Shinobi World War, he fought and overcame multiple Kage-level and above opponents before
            defeating Sasuke while exhausted, leading others to believe that Naruto had surpassed
            the previous Hokage. Two years after the War, Naruto could single handily defeat Toneri Ōtsutsuki
            despite his usage of the Tenseigan Naruto's abilities continued to improve in the following
            years, ultimately becoming the Seventh Hokage.

                  Initially, Naruto constantly failed to utilise basic techniques like clones or
                  transformations, except his own invention, the Sexy Technique. Over time, he
                  became able to master more complex techniques, surpassing Kakashi in ninjutsu
                  prowess. Naruto is capable in shurikenjutsu, using shadow clones to barrage an
                  enemy or storing weapons in scrolls. He displays some skill in kenjutsu as an
                  adult, and knows to how counter genjutsu, but is not shown using it.

                  Naruto's second trademark technique is the <mark>Rasengan</mark>, a one-handed technique
                  created by his father. Due to his poor chakra control, Naruto often uses a
                  shadow clone to form the spherical shape while he provides the chakra. Over
                  time, Naruto's improved skill allows him to produce larger versions of the
                  Rasengan, perform it faster, and even have his shadow clones make their own
                  Rasengan. During the Fourth Shinobi World War, he became able to form a
                  Rasengan and its variants without any shadow clones or transformations.
                  Naruto has also shown the ability to release the Rasengan as an energy wave,
                  or as a projectile in the anime.

              Naruto's skills with fūinjutsu have not been explored greatly, but he knew how to
              use the seal's key after receiving Gerotora, and later resealed Kurama after he
              separated a majority of chakra from the fox. When accessing Shukaku's power, he
              can use its natural cursed seal markings to bind targets. During his meeting
              with Hagoromo, Naruto was taught the Six Paths — Chibaku Tensei, which when used
              with Sasuke, was strong enough to completely seal Kaguya.

                After mastering Sage Mode, Naruto can detect and identify other chakra signatures
                from vast distances, allowing him to better react to and counter very fast opponents.
                He also gained the ability to sense negative emotions after taking control of Kurama's
                chakra. Naruto can also use both of these abilities simultaneously through his senjutsu
                -enhanced Tailed Beast Mode and the Six Paths Sage Mode respectively. Upon achieving
                the latter, Naruto's sensory capabilities were empowered to the highest possible level,
                 making it possible for him to sense the other half of Hagoromo's chakra,
                 as well as Madara's shadows.
